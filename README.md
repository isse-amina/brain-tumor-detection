# Brain Tumor Detection

Medical image processing is an ever-growing field in which a database of either CT scans or MRI images are used in the training of various machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we compare the performance of three learning models in their detection of brain tumors. Specifically, we opted to train the following models: the k-means cluster, the k-nearest neighbor and the multilayer perceptron. Each model is designed to output the integer “1” if it predicts that the brain is tumorous, and zero otherwise. To assess their performance, we compared their classification reports as well as their computational times.
